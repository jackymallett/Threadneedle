Threadneedle takes a new approach to Economic research, examining economic
structures as distributed systems and grounding them in network analysis and 
information theory. It is the first fully open-source software for simulating 
economies based on an accurate reproduction of the double entry book keeping 
transactions used by all modern banks.
Sciences such as Physics, Chemistry, and Computer Science, have proceeded 
by detailed investigation and experimentation with the micro-structure of
their fields to build up the considerable foundations on which they are 
currently based.  As there is as yet no theory for the 'atomic level" of 
economics, its methodology has taken a different path, 
and a number of economic phenomena and crises are left unexplained. 

We believe that developing detailed simulations of the economy, based on individual 
financial transactions and market based pricing, can begin to address the
current impasse in which (macro-)economics has found itself. Our approach is grounded
in the scientific method, and we welcome collaboration with people who share our vision of developing a 
basis for economic investigation based on the scientific method. If you would like to contribute or collaborate in 
this endeavour, please contact Dr. Jacky Mallett (jacky@iiim.is)


### Funding 

Threadneedle was originally funded by the Icelandic Institute of Intelligent Machines on the initiative of its Principle Investigator and Senior Researcher Dr. Jacky Mallett, and IIIM's Director Dr. Kris R. Thórisson. IIIM has benefited from competitive research grants organized by the Science and Technology Policy Board of Iceland and administered by Rannís, Iceland.
